# Patient Dashboard Stats Update

## Overview
Updated the stats cards in the patient dashboard to show more relevant and actionable metrics for patients managing their healthcare and insurance claims.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced `getStats()` Function
- Added patient-specific logic with dedicated calculations
- Now supports three distinct user types: Doctor, Patient, and Insurance/Bank
- Each role gets customized statistics relevant to their needs

### 2. Patient-Specific Stats Cards

#### Card 1: Total Claims
- **Icon**: FileText (blue)
- **Metric**: Total number of claims submitted by the patient
- **Description**: "All time claims"

#### Card 2: Approved Claims
- **Icon**: CheckCircle (green)
- **Metric**: Number of claims that have been approved or paid
- **Description**: "Successfully approved"

#### Card 3: Upcoming Appointments
- **Icon**: Calendar (purple)
- **Metric**: Number of future appointments that are pending or accepted
- **Description**: "Scheduled visits"

#### Card 4: Amount Approved
- **Icon**: DollarSign (yellow)
- **Metric**: Total amount approved/reimbursed from claims
- **Description**: "Total reimbursed"

### 3. Advanced Calculations for Patients

#### Upcoming Appointments Logic:
```typescript
const upcomingAppointments = appointments.filter((appointment: any) => {
  const appointmentDate = new Date(appointment.scheduledAt)
  return appointmentDate >= today && 
         (appointment.status === AppointmentStatus.PENDING || 
          appointment.status === AppointmentStatus.ACCEPTED)
}).length
```

#### Amount Approved Logic:
```typescript
const totalAmountApproved = claims
  .filter((c: Claim) => c.status === ClaimStatus.APPROVED || c.status === ClaimStatus.PAID)
  .reduce((sum: number, claim: Claim) => 
    sum + (parseFloat(claim.approvedAmount || '0') || parseFloat(claim.claimAmount)), 0)
```

### 4. Three-Tier Role-Based Display

#### Doctors See:
- Total Appointments
- Today's Schedule
- Pending Requests
- Total Patients

#### Patients See:
- Total Claims
- Approved Claims
- Upcoming Appointments
- Amount Approved

#### Insurance/Bank See:
- Total Claims
- Approved Claims
- Pending Claims
- Total Amount

## Benefits for Patients

### Healthcare Management:
1. **Claims Overview**: Quick view of total claims submitted
2. **Success Rate**: See how many claims have been approved
3. **Appointment Planning**: Track upcoming scheduled visits
4. **Financial Insight**: Monitor total reimbursements received

### User Experience:
- **Actionable Metrics**: Each stat provides clear next steps
- **Financial Clarity**: Amount approved shows real monetary value
- **Schedule Awareness**: Upcoming appointments help with planning
- **Progress Tracking**: Approved vs total claims shows success rate

### Visual Design:
- **Color Psychology**: Green for success (approved claims), Purple for planning (appointments)
- **Intuitive Icons**: FileText for claims, CheckCircle for approval, Calendar for appointments, DollarSign for money
- **Consistent Layout**: Maintains responsive design across all devices

## Technical Features

### Smart Date Filtering:
- Only counts future appointments as "upcoming"
- Filters by appointment status (PENDING or ACCEPTED)
- Uses proper date comparison with time normalization

### Flexible Amount Calculation:
- Prioritizes `approvedAmount` when available
- Falls back to `claimAmount` for approved claims without specific approved amounts
- Handles null/undefined values gracefully

### Role Isolation:
- Each user type gets completely different statistics
- No overlap or confusion between role contexts
- Maintains backward compatibility for existing Insurance/Bank users

## Files Modified
- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Updated stats calculation and display logic

## Status: âœ… COMPLETE
Patient dashboard now shows healthcare-focused statistics that help patients manage their claims, track appointments, and monitor their financial benefits effectively.
