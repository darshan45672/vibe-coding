# Doctor Dashboard Stats Update

## Overview
Updated the stats cards in the doctor dashboard to show relevant and useful metrics for doctors instead of generic claim statistics.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `getStats()` Function
- Added role-based logic to calculate different statistics for doctors vs other users
- For doctors, calculates:
  - Total appointments count
  - Today's appointments count
  - Pending appointment requests count
  - Completed appointments count
  - Unique patients count

### 2. Doctor-Specific Stats Cards

#### Card 1: Total Appointments
- **Icon**: Calendar (blue)
- **Metric**: Total number of appointments the doctor has
- **Description**: "All time appointments"

#### Card 2: Today's Schedule
- **Icon**: CalendarCheck (green)
- **Metric**: Number of appointments scheduled for today
- **Description**: "Appointments today"

#### Card 3: Pending Requests
- **Icon**: Clock (yellow)
- **Metric**: Number of appointment requests awaiting doctor approval
- **Description**: "Awaiting approval"

#### Card 4: Total Patients
- **Icon**: Users (purple)
- **Metric**: Count of unique patients the doctor has seen
- **Description**: "Unique patients"

### 3. Preserved Original Stats for Other Roles
- Patients, Insurance, and Bank users still see the original claim-based statistics
- Maintains backward compatibility and relevance for non-doctor users

## Benefits

1. **Appointment Overview**: Quick view of total and today's appointments

- **Intuitive Icons**: Clear visual representation of each metric

## Technical Implementation

- Efficient data filtering and counting
- TypeScript-safe with proper type handling
- Responsive design maintained across all screen sizes
